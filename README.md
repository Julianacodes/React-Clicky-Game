# Clicky Game

## Overview
I created a Star Wars themed memory game with React. This assignment required me to break up my application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

## Game Break Down

* The applicationwill show you different images. Click on the image but try not to select the smae image more than once!

* The images will shuffle around and there is a score tracker to let you know how many points you have. 

* If you click the same image more than once you will lose and the game will start over again. 

* See if you can beat the highscore
